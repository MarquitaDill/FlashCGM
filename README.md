# XDrip-Flashring
Repository of work to alter Fitbit Ionic Flashring Watch Face to support Blood Glucose data display from XDrip+ and hopefully directly from nightscout sites (secondary focus but waiting until all the functionality is verified, it might just work)

Design Goals:
   1) Perform as much processing on phone companion app as possible to maintain watch battery life.
   2) Provide at-a-glance info about current BG, trend, and polling status.
   3) Tap to view chart of last X readings graphically.
   4) Document in-code as much as possible to support ongoing development/support of this watch face for users.

Current Watch Face Status:
Display elements in main screen in place but not complete, button overlays between display screens functional but content in second screen needs work.  
Screens currently look as follows. Tap the upper right box of main display to get to graph, anywhere on graph to get back to main.
