# XDrip-Flashring
Repository of work to alter Fitbit Ionic Flashring Watch Face to support Blood Glucose data display from XDrip+ and directly from nightscout sites.

Design Goals:
   1) Perform as much processing on phone companion app as possible to maintain watch battery life.
   2) Provide at-a-glance info about current BG, trend, and polling status.
   3) Tap BG Value to view chart of last 24 readings graphically.  Tap to return.
   4) Document in-code as much as possible to support ongoing development/support of this watch face for users.

Current Watch Face Status:
Screens currently look as follows. Tap the upper right box of main display to get to graph, anywhere on graph to get back to main.
Currently deciding if I will submit this as-is to fitbit or add high/low vibe alerts first.
