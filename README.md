# XDrip+Flashring
Design Goals:
   1) Perform as much processing on phone companion app as possible to maintain watch battery life.
   2) Provide at-a-glance info about current BG, trend, and polling status.
   3) Tap to view chart of last X readings graphically.
   4) Document in-code as much as possible to support ongoing development/support of this watch face for users.

Current Watch Face Status:
Display elements in main screen in place but currently static, button overlays between display screens functional but no content in second screen yet.  Main screen looks as follows.
